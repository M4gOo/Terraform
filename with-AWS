========= Setup an AWS Account ==========

https://aws.amazon.com/


======== IAM ==================
management console - only root can access 
IAM policy - assign privileges, json format
IAM Group - can be made to assign policy instead users individually, but even they are in the group you can add other permissions
individually to a user.

To services have access to each other (example S3 to EC2), by default they are not connect, must create a IAM role
IAM role - allow securely grant access to an AWS service to act on other AWS service in the account
Ex.: create a S3 access role to be applied on the EC2 service, with the role we can attach the same IAM policy that, for example,
you create for the developer group. Once this role is attached to an EC2 instance, that instance should have complete access to 
the S3 service

IAM role con provide access to an IAM user beloging to another AWS acc, provide access to applications to interact with services
in AWS and provide access to users managed outside AWS

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs  -> filter IAM
good practice for terraform IAM access 
    to not hardcode the credential in the conf file (this file it will be in version control), so save in
/home/user/.aws/config/credentials (this is inside home dir of the user)
    another is making use of env variables in conf file (export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ...)
    
============= S3 ===============
S3 - simple storage service
data in S3 is stored in the form of an S3 bucket (bucket = container/dir)
must be unique name, because aws creates a DNS name for it
should be DNS compliant name = no uppercase or underscores
max file size 5TB

any object in an S3 bucket consists of an object data (key = value) and metadata (detail about the object =>owner, size, last modified)
to a user/group have access a bucket, it necessary a bucket policy

========== DynamoDB ===============
no SQL DB provided by AWS
full managed by AWS
there are no servers that the users have to manage
high availability replicated across multiple regions
stores data in the form key value pairs

==============EC2===============
virtual machines 
Elastic compute cloud instance - EC2
they have pre-configured templates (AMIs - amazon machine image)

general  instance is more commonly used type 
T2,T3,M5, etc tey are type of general instance and they have different sizes (vCPU and memory GB)
EBS volume to be attached to EC2 instance
