========= Setup an AWS Account ==========

https://aws.amazon.com/


======== IAM ==================
management console - only root can access 
IAM policy - assign privileges, json format
IAM Group - can be made to assign policy instead users individually, but even they are in the group you can add other permissions
individually to a user.

To services have access to each other (example S3 to EC2), by default they are not connect, must create a IAM role
IAM role - allow securely grant access to an AWS service to act on other AWS service in the account
Ex.: create a S3 access role to be applied on the EC2 service, with the role we can attach the same IAM policy that, for example,
you create for the developer group. Once this role is attached to an EC2 instance, that instance should have complete access to 
the S3 service

IAM role con provide access to an IAM user beloging to another AWS acc, provide access to applications to interact with services
in AWS and provide access to users managed outside AWS

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs  -> filter IAM
good practice for terraform access programmactic
    to not hardcode the credential in the conf file (this file it will be in version control), so save in
/home/user/.aws/config/credentials (this is inside home dir of the user)
    another is making use of env variables in conf file (export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ...)
