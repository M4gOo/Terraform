  ===================== Variable ===========================
  
 hardcoding value is not a good idea, re-use the  code
 
 VARIABLE .TF                              
  variable "filename" {                     
    default = "/root/pets.txt"
 }
 
  MAIN.TF
  resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename = var.filename
    content = var.content
  }
  
  after change update using terraform apply
