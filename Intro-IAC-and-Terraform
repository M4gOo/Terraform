Cloud infrastructure ocmes with support for APIs good for automation
Using scripts (shell or programming languages to yrty to automate infrastructure provisioning to deploy environments faster 
and in a consistentet fashion by leveraging the API functionalities

IAC tools
    - Configuration Management: ansbile, puppet, chef, salt stack = used to install and manage software on existing infra 
      resources (servers, dbs, networki devices, etc), version control (playbooks), idempotent (can run the code 
      multiple times and everything you run it will only make changes that are necessary to bring the env into a define 
      state w/o having to write any additional code)
    - Provisioning Tools: terraform, cloudformation 
    - Server Tramplating: docker, packer, vagrant = create a custom image of VM or container, they have all the required
      software and dependencies installed on them, instead of updating the running instance like Ansible they update the 
      image and then re-deploy a new instance using the updated image
    
Provisioning by making use of the management console of vaarious cloud providers. The better way to provision cloud infra
is to codify the entire provisioning process = IAC (Infrastructure as Code)
You can manage nearly any infra component as code (DB, networks, storage, app conf)
It is not easy to manage, requires programming or dev skills to build and maintain, not easily reusable. That's like Terraform
and Ansible help with code (easy to learn, human readable and maintain)

HCL -hashicorp conf language is a simple declarative language
.tf - extension

Terraform works in 3 phases - init, plan and apply
  init - identifies the providers to be used
  plan - drafts a plan to get to the target state
  apply - makes the necessary changes to required on the target environment to bring it to the desired state
